# Churn Modelling with Artificial Neural Networks

## Overview
This project is focused on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for predicting customer churn, specifically for a banking dataset. Using customer data, the project aims to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer churn and leverage these insights to predict future churn probabilities.

## Dataset
The `Churn_Modelling.csv` file is the core dataset used. It includes customer details such as credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products used, has credit card, is an active member, estimated salary, and churn flag.

## Implementation Details
`ANN.ipynb` is a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that includes the following sections:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset, handling missing values, feature encoding, and data normalization.
2. **Model Building**: Constructing the ANN layers using TensorFlow and Keras.
3. **Training**: Details on training parameters, batch size, and number of epochs.
4. **Evaluation**: Techniques used to evaluate the model's performance, including accuracy and loss metrics.

## Requirements
- Python version: 3.x
- Key Libraries: 
  - TensorFlow (for model building and training)
  - Keras (for creating neural network layers)
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - NumPy (for numerical operations)
  - Scikit-Learn (for data preprocessing)
